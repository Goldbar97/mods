[h1] IMPORTANT [/h1]
[list]
[*] Favorite any item ([i]right-click → “favorite”[/i]) if you don’t want it to be packed!
[/list]

[h2] What Does EasyPacking Do? [/h2]
[list]
[*] This mod lets you bundle multiple copies of the same item (often in 5s or 10s), saving 30–50% weight.  
[*] Works with [b]vanilla[/b] items by default; also supports a select few other mods as well via Addons.  
[*] For more details (including item lists, translations, and FAQ), see the discussions below!
[/list]

[h2] Quick Tips [/h2]
[list]
[*] Just enable [b]EasyPacking[/b] to pack vanilla items.  
[*] If you see an error about “requires firearmmod” or any other mod, you’ve accidentally enabled an [b]EasyPacking Addon[/b] without having that mod installed. Disable that Addon or install the matching mod.
