[*]Thanks to [b]Diakon[/b], there's much technical improvement in this mod. Now it has more mod compatibility. The weight is dynamic, depending on what mods you're using. Also packed item remembers the item's capacity, you don't need full items to pack. Most of bugs should be fixed by pack and unpack iteration.


[*]Thanks to [b]Mr.Nekuromu[/b], we can view the items with 3d models. You can now decorate your safe house with this mod. He ended 2D models when it's on the ground and show you guys beautiful modelings!
